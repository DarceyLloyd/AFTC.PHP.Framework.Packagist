Helpers
A collection of functions by vendor/helper_name.php
They are not class's and should not use packages or libraries or framework functionality.

Libraries
Libraries are php classes which help with a task, they should not use packages, other libraries but may use framework functionality.

Modules
Modules are sub applications which can use packages but shouldn't rely on any helpers or libraries installed into the framework or your application. They should be loosly coupled, installed and un-installed using the AFTC command line utility to maintain composer.json integrity.
