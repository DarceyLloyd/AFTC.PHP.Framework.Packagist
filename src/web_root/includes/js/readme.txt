Got js includes? here they go...

For smaller sites I would recommend just placing your includes in this folder, for larger sites I would use:

includes/js
	/page_or_module_name_1/include_file_name_1.js
	/page_or_module_name_1/include_file_name_2.js
	/page_or_module_name_2/include_file_name_1.js
	/page_or_module_name_2/include_file_name_2.js
etc
