/* Media queries 
Tips:
	- Adjust your break points based on your content and then take into account device break points
	- Try to use ems or % instead of px (supposed to zoom better) http://pxtoem.com/ (I'm a px fan myself)
	- Try and keep your queries simple as you can
	- If your queries are getting extremely large or complicated split your content up into multiple files
	- When your width re-sizing like exampled below, take some off to ensure you dont end up with scroll bars

Some resolutions to consider:
(min-width:320px) smartphones, portrait iPhone, portrait 480x320 phones
(min-width:480px) smartphones, Android phones, landscape iPhone
(min-width:600px) portrait tablets, portrait iPad, e-readers (Nook/Kindle), landscape 800x480 phones (Android)
(min-width:801px) tablet, landscape iPad, lo-res laptops ands desktops
(min-width:1025px) big landscape tablets, laptops, and desktops
(min-width:1281px) hi-res laptops and desktops
